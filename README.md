# Lonely Cosmos

Lonely Cosmos is a solo graduation project for NCCU DCT capstone. <br>
The project focuses on exploring the gestures of hovering on desktop and tapping/dragging on touchscreen.

Inspired by graduation, Lonely Cosmos is more or less the monolougue of mine made with fear for uncertainty, unexpected changes in life and some pieces of me, metaphorically of course.<br> 
It's kind of a way to tackle the unknown and the glamorous, future, itself, and to tyr to find the balance of being present and countering the quarter life crisis.

Would recommend to have [this piece of music](https://soundcloud.com/chillhopdotcom/idealism-snowfall
) at background when playing with my project!
