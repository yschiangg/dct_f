# Lonely Cosmos
![project name](https://i.imgur.com/nDK4VE6.jpg)

Lonely Cosmos is the solo graduation project of Yi Shyuan Chiang for DCT capstone. <br>
The project focuces on exploring the gestures of hovering on desktop and tapping/dragging on touchscreen.

Inspired by graduation, Lonely Cosmos is more or less the monolougue of mine made with fear for uncertainty, unexpected changes in life and some pieces of me, metaphorically of course.<br> 
Lonely Cosmos is my way to tackle the unknown and the glamorous future itself.

Would recommend to go [this piece of music](https://soundcloud.com/chillhopdotcom/idealism-snowfall
) when playing with my project!
