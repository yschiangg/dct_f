# Lonely Cosmos
![project name](https://i.imgur.com/nDK4VE6.jpg)

Lonely Cosmos is the solo graduation project of Yi Shyuan Chiang for DCT capstone. <br>
The project focuces on exploring the gestures of hovering on desktop and tapping/dragging on touchscreen.

Inspired by graduation, Lonely Cosmos is more or less the monolougue of mine made with fear for uncertainty, unexpected changes in life and some pieces of me, metaphorically of course.<br> 
It's kind of a way to tackle the unknown and the glamorous future itself, tyring to find the balance of being present and the quarter life crisis.

Would recommend to have [this piece of music](https://soundcloud.com/chillhopdotcom/idealism-snowfall
) at background when playing with my project!

You can also download my project [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17WH13F8zjXuYAozB4ckqQadE8X6ZY2ef) to have a better experience cause then we don't need to rely on online storage and it being laggy.
